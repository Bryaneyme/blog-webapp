# blog-webapp
## My first fully independent full stack project, designed by myself.

This blog webapp is a simple project, designed to have me practice all my knowledge with HTML, CSS, Javascript, EJS, Node and Express, alongside Figma for its design.

This has been an incredibly fun, sometimes frustrating, project, which allowed me to learn the following things:

Firstly, how to link everything together.
Then: 
- Proper HTML structure with significant classes
- HTML forms, sending requests this way
- CSS added, somewhat structured as well
- Learned Pseudo-classes, and made the buttons somewhat kinda nice-looking haha
- Applied Flexbox/CSS
- Express server (server routing, body parsing middleware, logic functions)
- EJS, so rendering through that sever. Learned more of its templating language, and logic.
- Tried to apply some best practices as well

I've used the GitHub Kanban board to organize the tasks, and that helped tremendously. You can probably see the current backlog, I've applied some of my ex-product owner knowledge to craft those stories (only backlog, not the "done" ones haha)

Concerning soft skills, I've learned to be even more frustrated with code, spend some hours wanting to break my head open, and learn how to take a break, come back to it eventually as well.

I still need to learn:
- Correct logging
- Testing
- Scalable project structure
- And.. as you might have figured out, how to interact with a proper database.

Super fun project, Hopefully I'll be able to deply it somewhere, instead of have the code just sit here and do nothing haha...
